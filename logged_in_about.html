								<h2>About Us</h2>

								<p>BandanAir exists to provide a product that addresses these hazards, and do so in a bold way. Using cutting edge filtration technology, we were able to design a sleek bandana that combines the stylish patterns of the modern rave scene with fibrous materials that both block out dust and air particles from entering your body, and a combination of space age fibers that provide an optimized air flow to ensure clear breathing in music festivals.</p>

								<p>We are a company based on style, safety, and constant innovation; providing new products that can enhance your experience in music festivals. We are the first and only clear-breathing face mask company in the world. And as music and EDM culture changes, so too will we to provide you with the best possible product.</p>

								<h2>The Founders</h2>

								<p>On September 18th, 2017 BandanAir founders: John Herrick, Austin Ly, and Frank Huang realized that there was a need
									to provide a fashionable solution to clean breathing in outdoor music festivals. They turned that
									idea into the vision that would shape <strong>BandanAir.</strong></p>

									<h3>John Herrick</h3>
									<p>A Computer Science Major from the University of Virginia, John Herrick spent his early life admiring Electronic Dance
										Music and the culture surrounding it. He is an aspiring full-stack engineer with specialties in front-end development, and
										in the Summer of 2017, he honed those skills at his job at IBM as a Cognitive Software Developer. His dream is to see Cognitive
										Software and Machine Learning encompass every aspect of technology in the tangible world: from home automation to provide for
										enhanced living, to our very infrastructure of buisness and manufacturing. In his spare time, he enjoys DJing parties, working out,
									and scuba diving.</p>

									<h3>Austin Ly</h3>
									<p>Just two years ago, Austin found himself dragged by a friend into the celebration of music and culture that defines Electronic Dance Music  and found it to be unlike any other movement he had ever experienced. Today he stands as a self-described veteran of EDM, having seen over 20 artists live. Though he remains in love with this scene, he recognized some of the health risks associated with raving and took it upon himself to work towards promoting harm reduction along with his two colleagues. Another Computer Science major from the University of Virginia, Austin enjoys exploring what the world has to offer in his free time.</p>

									<h3>Frank Huang</h3>
									<p>Last year, Frank was invited by friends to go to a concert given by reknowned EDM artist Marshmellow. Skeptical at first, he was amazed by how immersive and euphoric EDM concerts are. Frank wants to specialize in being more aware of the different applications technology can offer in the grand scheme of the Internet of Things, which is why he signed on to work on BandanAir with John and Austin. He is a Computer Science and Economics major from the University of Virginia and spends his free time eating string cheese and keeping up with what's new in the technology space.</p>
